# AI-Based Data Quality Prediction App

This project is a **Streamlit web application** that uses an **IBM Cloud deployed machine learning model** to predict **data quality issues** in order-related data.

Users can enter order details through a simple UI, and the app sends this data to an IBM Cloud ML endpoint to get real-time predictions.
